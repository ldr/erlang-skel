An empty erlang project with skeleton files for gen_* modules.
Also contains a Rakefile for building, generating docs, etc.

The skeleton files are extracted from erlware-mode which can be found here:
http://www.erlware.org/erlware-mode/

The skeleton files are extended with -type and -spec declarations in addition
to the already defined @spec, see: http://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0008.html

(for now, only behaviour_gen_server.erl has -spec declarations, rest will follow)

The Rakefile is copied from the following project:
